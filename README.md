# Tribal

**Tribal** is a vCard decoding/encoding Go library currently in development.
Its key feature will be **unified handling of the text-based vCard formats**, allowing high-level reading, manipulation, and writing of the vCard data model across versions.
To do so in compliance with the standards and still work leniently with the incompliant implementations in existence is a challenge through, for which reason **effort currently is going towards throrough analysis** of the more than two decades of standards, documenting how best to interpret and implement them.

For more information and access to the vCard documentation produced so far [check out the wiki][wiki].
